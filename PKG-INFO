        ================
        mboxattachments is a Python class for extracting all embedded files in 
        a group of emails.  It was developed to assist in the running of a 
        photography club.  Members of the club would regularly send emails 
        containing images to the club secretary.  The secretary would manually
        save the attachments, organize those files, and prepare a show for the 
        members.  The manual saving process was time consuming and error prone.
        
        This utility allows downloading all the attachments in a set of emails
        contained in an mbox file. Conveniently, gmail permits exporting emails
        as mbox files

        On debian and Windows 7 the following is known to work
        
        ::
        
           pip install mboxattachments
        
        
        
        ---------
        Running
        ---------
        ::

        ::
        
          mboxattachments --filter_from flur  --exportpath images emails.mbox
          
        The above line will test all email messages in the file emails.mbox
        to see the the senders name (FROM field) matches the regular expression 
        flur.  If an mail matches, all of its attachments will be written to 
        a file in the directory images. 
        
        ::
        
          mboxattachments --SQstart 1000  --exportpath images emails.mbox
        
        The above command will save the attachments from every file in 
        emails.bmox.  The file names will be of the form
        SQ1000....,
        SQ1001....,
        SQ1003....

           mboxattachments [--help] [--version] [--debug] [--filter_from regexp]

                           [--exportpath path] [--SQstart value]  input_mbox_file ...
                     
          attachments are stored as separate files
          file names are of the form 
          <sequence number>-<email subject>-<email sender>-<file name of attachment>
            for example, a possible file name is
